In lab 007 Q1:
I sucessfully use of dynamic memory allocation in order to "change the size of an array" when in essence what i'm really doing is:
	1. Creating a temporary array and using loops to populate it with the same values as the old array
	2. Deleting the old array through dynamic memory allocation
	3. Increasing the size of the array variable (by one in this case)
	4. Creating a new array of the same name (b/c the old one's storage was released thus the name can be reused) with a size of the new size variable (up by one here)
	5. Populating the new array with the same values as the temporary array using loops (thus leaving the 1 extra new space unoccupied)
	6. Deleting the temporary array
