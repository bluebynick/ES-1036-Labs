To Acces Other Account Team Services and Details in Visual Studio

Go to Server Explorer again, right-click on the Azure node and choose 
Manage and filter subscriptions. Choose the new account by clicking the 
drop down arrow next to the current account, and then choose which 
subscriptions you want to display in Server Explorer. You should see all
the services associated with the specified subscription.Even though you 
are not currently signed in to the Visual Studio IDE with the second
account, you are signed in to that account's services and resources. The 
same is true for Project > Add Connected Service and Team > Connect to 
Team Foundation Server.
