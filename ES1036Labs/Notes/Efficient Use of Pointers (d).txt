I used pointers in a really great, efficient way to only require one loop structure, but changing the variable being computed within. This eliminates the need for a second loop for a second variable. This was done in the while loop in the main. I did this by:
	1. Declaring a pointer and making it equal to the first variable
	2. Running the loop and using a comparison within to the dereference of the pointer
	3. After the loop has run a second time, make the pointer point to the second variable
	4. The loop will now run, in respect to the second variable (because the computed variable is still the deference of the pointer, but it's just pointing to something else now)
