# ES-1036-Labs
These were my responese to the assignements of the ES1036 first year programming fundementals course. C++

Notes for me:

In lab 003 Q2:
-I used method calls and passing variables in methods for the first time in c++
-I ecountered a sequencial error that I corrected and explained in the notes folder (a)

In lab 004 Q1:
-I used method calls and makes use of Switch structure to handle the program direction
-I used a do while loop for error catching (my first do-While loop yeeek)
-I encoutered a pointer error that I corrected and explained in the notes folder (b)

In lab 004 Q3:
-I dabbled in pointers in oder to create the array with a variable size

In lab 005 Q1:
-I used isalpha() correrctly in this code

In lab 005 Q2:
-I used the time library and makes use of rudementary pointers in order to get current date and time
-I used a warning disable thing #pragma warning(disable : 4996)
-I used a nested switch statement in do while loop in a neat way where one of the cases just ends the code and the loop is actually infite until it meets that condition

In lab 006 Q1:
-I used a very efficient while(true) structure

In lab 007 Q1:
-I modified my methods from lab 005 Q2 and made them more efficient
-I used of a bubble sort with full explanation in comments of the code 
-I sucessfully use of dynamic memory allocation in order to "change the size of an array" which I fully explained in the notes folder (c)
